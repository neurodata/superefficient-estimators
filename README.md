

This repo contains basic info for how to organize a repo, and the contents therein.
Note several things:

 - the organization of this repo, ie, the directories and sub-directories
 - the license, we always use Apache2
 - the .gitignore file is useful
 - the 'Draft' folder provides a readme file explaining how to tell the story of your manuscript, as well as a template latex, markdown, and html file

Some notes about the poster:

 - top bar is title, authors, and affiliations.  
   - the contact author is the first and senior author.
   - the title should fit on 1 line, and be big
 - the second 'bar' is the 'abstract bar', organized much like the abstract/introduction of the paper (see [https://github.com/openconnectome/ocp_template/blob/master/README.md]), but with only 4 sections: background, challenge, action, and resolution
 - below this are those same exact 4 sections, organized such that action is the biggest and central
 - references, acknowledgements, and logos are at the bottom (note that logos never go at the top, they are not part of your story)
 - an excellent *vertical* example is in this repo called 'm2g poster', an excellent horizontal one is coming soon.
 - we like making posters in lucidchart, here is a link to the m2g poster: [https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/0c61e310-7a34-4f77-894c-6b624fd519d5]
